## Solution for Module 1 Challenge

This site has been created as the landing page for the Horiseon corporation, which also currently serves as the entirety of the site as well, providing information on several subjects.  The site itself presents the information in a concise and informative manner, yet the code was not semantic or complying with accessibility standards.  The task was to maintain the look and feel of the website, while making the code semantic, as well as adding information to allow for accessibility.  In the process I learned the different possibilities for semantic tags as well as their uses.  Additionally I learned creative ways to change code yet maintain the look of the website.
